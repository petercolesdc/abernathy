# Absracts styles

Styles are unique to each application, but contain some standard syntax that is present across all applications. The theory here is that each application will likely need a unique set of settings, but these can be based on standard settings.

The rule of thumb for this folder is that it should not output a single line of CSS when compiled on its own. These are nothing but Sass helpers.
